# About Me

I'm been programming since I was 15, professionally for the last 20+ years. I'm a [boring programmer](https://boringtechnology.club/) who likes to [keep things simple](https://grugbrain.dev/).

I enjoy working in typed statically compiled languages that support functional flavored programming, however Ruby is my bread-and-butter. Though primarily a web developer, I am also comfortable working in relatively low level local application development.

I write at [my personal website](http://www.timgittos.com) about things that interest me - mostly tech, career programming and adjacent topics.

## Interests

I'm interested in pretty much all aspects of the technicals of software development, and have a specific passion around tooling and boilerplate elimination.

Specifically, I'm fascinated with creating rich experience using nothing but bits in automated ways, which draws me to:

- Computer graphics
- Generative AI
- Audio synthesis/multi-media synthesis
- Developer tooling/automation
- Literate programming/alternate programming ideas
- IDEs

# Professional Experience

- 14 years of Ruby on Rails in local IT tooling, telehealth, and insurance industries
- 6 years of C# in e-commerce and public safety/UAVs
- 1 year of Clojure in IT tooling

# Non-professional Experience

- Python in data analysis, AI, web development, and CLI tooling
- Golang in local dev tooling, and web tooling
- C++ in computer graphics, game development, and agentic AI
- Rust in computer graphics
